## Atomatic Attendence System using face recognition
## <br> <b>Steps to follow:</b>
#### Step 1)Create Dataset (refer Videotoimg.ipynb)
        Divide the images like folderstructure.png
#### Step 2)Working with google Colab(if you don't know refer this https://medium.com/deep-learning-turkey/google-colab-free-gpu-tutorial-e113627b9f5d)
        Upload the dataset to google Drive and face_detection_model folder
        Now the colab folder structure should look like colabstructure.png
#### step 3)Crop the faces and save them to new dataset1 folder with same structure(test,train,val)



Trainig the model(refer vggface.ipynb)
#### step 4)Integrate the trained model with openCV to recognize the faces(refer output.ipynb)
